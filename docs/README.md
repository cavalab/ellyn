Documentation
===

ellyn is fast because it uses a c++ library to do most of the computation. However, once you have it installed, you can use it just like you would any other scikit-learn estimator, which makes it easy to do cross validation, ensemble learning, or to build any other kind of ML pipeline design. Follow the installation guide to get it up and running. 

Installation
============
These instructions are written for an [anaconda3](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) default python installation, but you can easily modify the paths to point to your installation. 

```bash

git clone https://github.com/cavalab/ellyn

cd ellyn

conda env create environment.yml

conda activate ellyn-env

python setup.py install
```

`environment.yml` lists the package dependencies for ellyn, if you'd like to install them yourself.

Usage
=====
In a python script, import ellyn:

```python
from ellyn import ellyn
```

ellyn uses the same nomenclature as [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/) supervised learning modules. 

Regression
----------

By default, ellyn does **regression**. 
You can initialize a few learner in python as:

```python
learner = ellyn()
```

or specify the generations, population size and selection algorithm as:

```python
learner = ellyn(g = 100, popsize = 25, selection = 'lexicase')
```

Classification
--------------

To do **classification**, ellyn implements the M4GP algorithm ([PDF](http://www.williamlacava.com/pubs/Multiclass_GP_journal_preprint.pdf)) for (multi-class) classification. 
To use it, pass these parameters:

```python 
learner = ellyn(classification=True, 
                class_m4gp=True, 
                prto_arch_on=True,
                selection='lexicase',
                fit_type='F1' # can be 'F1' or 'F1W' (weighted F1)
               )
```

Given a set of data with variables X and target Y, fit ellyn using the ```fit()``` method:

```python
learner.fit(X,Y)
```

You have now learned a model for your data. Predict your model's response on a new set of variables as

```python
y_pred = learner.predict(X_unseen)
```

Call ellyn from the terminal as

```bash
python -m ellyn.ellyn data_file_name -g 100 -p 50 -sel lexicase
```

try `python -m ellyn.ellyn --help` to see options.

GP options
